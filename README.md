# 📊 Yelp Business Reviews Analysis | End‑to‑End ELT Project

This project demonstrates a complete cloud-based data pipeline that ingests and analyzes large-scale Yelp review data using **Python**, **AWS S3**, and **Snowflake**. It covers ingestion, transformation, sentiment analysis, and insight extraction.

---

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- 📂 **5GB+ raw dataset** in deeply nested JSON format
- 🪓 **Split into 20+ files** for scalable ingestion via Python
- ☁️ **Uploaded to AWS S3** and loaded into Snowflake using external stages
- 🧠 **Sentiment analysis** using Python UDF with TextBlob inside Snowflake
- 📈 Performed advanced SQL analytics to uncover business insights

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech Stack

| Tool          | Purpose                                 |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| Python        | Data splitting, S3 upload                |
| AWS S3        | Scalable object storage for raw data     |
| Snowflake     | Cloud data warehouse + SQL & Python UDFs |
| TextBlob      | Sentiment analysis (Python in Snowflake) |
| SQL           | Data transformation and insights         |

## 🧠 Key Steps

1. **Split JSON**  
   Preprocess the large Yelp review file into ~20 smaller chunks using Python.

2. **Upload to S3**  
   Store files in AWS S3 buckets (`/reviews/`, `/business/`) as a data lake.

3. **Snowflake External Stage**  
   Create external stages to load data using `VARIANT` and `LATERAL FLATTEN`.

4. **Sentiment Analysis**  
   Use a Python UDF with TextBlob inside Snowflake to classify each review.

5. **SQL Analytics**  
   Use CTEs, window functions, and aggregation to extract insights:
   - Top 3 recent reviews per business
   - Sentiment by city/category
   - Review trends
